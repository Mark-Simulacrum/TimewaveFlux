--- Add saving (and loading) of projects
	+-- Warn user if leaving unsaved page : Stop them!
	+- Versioning : Allow backtracking
	+- Autosave
--- Done Project Cross out ><
	+- By work unit
	+- Only leftmost can be crossed out
	+--- Work Done input fill with clicked amount
	+- Input accepts :
		#h
		#m
		## (<15 h; >=15 m)
		1h25m
	+- See if a line under the >< looks better
	+- Make sure input does not exceed remaining work units.
+--- Change hours into minutes (by 15minute dayLoad) Minute height of 20px #workUnit
+--- Change project info to only title
	- Modify day info cycle to stop if not enough space.
---- Change the daysPerPage input to increase and decrease daysPerPage evenly on both sides (actual zoom!)
--- Add selected project interface (also moused)
	+- Selected stores amount of minutes clicked, and day clicked.
	- Goes with GUI showing details of project, as well as buttons for modifying it
		- This GUI has these elements:
			+- Delete Project tie this into hours
			+- Delete/Add day hours
			- What's to the left and to the right of the current FOV
			+- Basic Project Information (deadline, start, name, amount of work done/totalWork)
			+- Spread project todo hours over future (>=now) evenly

			+Should update whenever one of these elements changes, but DO NOT do this like we do firstDay and daysPerPage
	+- Clear Selected project info when deselect
+--- Moused project shown in Selected Project info area, unless a project is selected
+--- Change Day title into Month day (year?)
	+- YYYY/MM/DD day of week under it
	+- moment.js?
+--- Add method to determine total amount of work units in project
	-- And already done work units
!----- Refactor Code
	+--- Clean up firstDay and daysPerPage
	+--- Make a better footer and header#addOne?
	--- Look through everything and clean what can be cleaned :)
	---- TestEverything
--- If too many hours in day, show it!
+--- Notification area
--- Replace range value/scrollbar with youtube style red bar, dots for each month, whole calendar
	- Now + 1y = totalCalendarDayCount
+--- Change minute delimeters to show when dragging
	+- Show on all days of moving project
	+- Do not show on other projects
+--- Multiunit project days, the last line should show day hours: 1.5/3.25 (workDone/workTotal)
